# Phishing Email: Intelligence Analyst @@@ AP Solutions

#### - On November 29th, 2024, I received a suspicious job listing from a recruiter by the name of "Vijay Kiran" representing "AP Solutions." The email seemed very legitimate until I investigated further...

1. Initially, I was excited, thinking a recruiter had gotten back to me. However, as I read through the email, my instincts kicked in, and something felt off about the job listing. The first thing I noticed was that the email was titled "Fwd: [message]," but there was no sign of a conversation thread, only the sender and me. This raised a red flagâ€”if the email had been forwarded, I should have seen the full chain of conversation. I also realized I did not recall ever speaking with a Vijay Kiran, which prompted me to immediately dig deeper-for fun.

2. I started by investigating the raw data to verify the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), SPF (Sender Policy Framework), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) and noticed only the DKIM had passed but the SPF and DMARC are labeled as none/unknown. This is suspicious because although the DKIM had passed, it just means that the email had not been altered during transmission and that its digital signature matches the sender's domain. 
- The SPF failing means that the email was not sent through an authenticated mail server. 
- The DKIM verifies both DKIM and SPF as an extra layer of security, it failing means that the email did not align with the sender domain's policies. 
- I checked the originating IP address on VirusTotal, which confirmed that it is malicious, traced back to the US.
